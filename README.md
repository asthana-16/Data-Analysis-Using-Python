# 🧠 Python Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Python-based Data Analysis project!  
This project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset using core Python libraries. It demonstrates how to clean and transform data, handle anomalies, visualize patterns, and draw meaningful insights.

---

## 📌 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Explore the dataset structure
- Identify and handle missing values and outliers
- Understand the distribution of variables
- Visualize trends and relationships between different features
- Gain insights that could be used for further modeling or reporting

## 📊 Features & Tasks Performed

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Identified and handled **missing values** using suitable imputation techniques.
- Detected and treated **outliers** using statistical methods.
- Analyzed **skewness** and applied transformations where needed to normalize distributions.

### 📈 Data Visualization
- Utilized **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to:
  - Plot distributions (histograms, KDE plots)
  - Compare variables (boxplots, scatterplots)
  - Detect patterns and anomalies
- Created **correlation heatmaps** to identify relationships between features.

### 🔍 Insights Extraction
- Drew insights from data trends and distributions.
- Highlighted skewed distributions, high-correlation pairs, and possible data quality issues.
